// ? WHAT SHOULD THIS COMPONENT DO - test the critical functionality

// 1. Display a table (or equiv.) on the page that contains
//    user cashout requests, along with two buttons that allow
//    the admin to either accept or reject that request.

// 2. When the admin clicks accept or reject, the request is
//    removed from the table.

// 3. If there are no requests, the component should display a
//    message that says no requests available and a button that
//    sends the admin back to the admin dashboard.
